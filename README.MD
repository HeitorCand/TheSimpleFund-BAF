## Day 01 - Documentation

### 1. Problem Statement

- What real-world problem are you solving?
- For whom is this a problem (which users, organizations, or communities)?
- Why is this problem urgent or important now?

### 2. Target User and User Need

- Who is your **primary user**?
- What is their **core need or pain point**?
- How do they currently solve this (workarounds, existing tools, manual processes)?

### 3. Solution Overview

#### 3.1 Main Idea

- One paragraph describing your solution in plain language.
- What is the **core user journey** or main use case?

#### 3.2 Why Stellar?

- How does the **Stellar ecosystem** help you solve this better?
- Which elements are you planning to use? For example:
  - Stellar network (payments, FX, remittances, anchors, stablecoins)
  - Soroban smart contracts
  - Wallets or on/off-ramps
  - Other Stellar-based tooling or services

### 4. Core Features (Planned for the Hackathon)

List 3–5 features you aim to have by the end of Stellar Hack+.

- Feature 1:
- Feature 2:
- Feature 3:
- (Optional) Stretch Goal:

For each feature, think about:
- What the user can actually **do**.
- How you will know if the feature is **working**.

### 5. MVP Architecture (Initial Idea)

> This is a **first draft**; it will evolve over the hackathon.

- Frontend: (e.g., React, mobile app, CLI, etc.)
- Backend / Services: (e.g., Node, Rust service, Python API, etc.)
- Smart Contracts: (e.g., Soroban contracts, which modules or responsibilities)
- Data / Storage: (e.g., Postgres, in-memory, files, indexers, etc.)

If possible, add a simple diagram (can be a screenshot or link) showing:
- User → Frontend → Backend/API → Soroban/Stellar → Any external services.

### 6. Success Criteria for the Hackathon

By the end of Stellar Hack+, we will consider our MVP successful if:

- [ ] A user can ______________________________
- [ ] We can demonstrate ______________________
- [ ] We can measure or show __________________

Be as concrete as possible (even if ambitious).
