# Roadmap — The Simple Fund: Going Beyond the Hackathon

## **Q3 2025: Project Kickoff and Initial Planning**

### **Objectives**

* Establish the core platform architecture (frontend, backend, blockchain).
* Tokenize receivables funds on the Stellar blockchain.
* Develop the smart contracts for fund shares, vault logic, and distributions.
* Implement the initial interfaces for Investors, Consultants, and Managers.
* Integrate non-custodial authentication via **Freighter Wallet**.

### **Key Milestones**

* User onboarding with wallet connection and identity validation.
* MVP launch enabling fund creation, share issuance, and basic distributions.
* Initial security, performance, and scalability tests.
* First version of **fund recommendation logic** based on metadata.

## **Q4 2025: Expansion and Feature Integration**

### **Objectives**

* Refine UI/UX using early-user insights, improving dashboards and workflows.
* Enable **secondary market liquidity** via Stellar DEX for tokenized fund shares.
* Add real-time **XLM → USD pricing** using CoinGecko.
* Integrate **Blend isolated lending pools** for on-chain yield generation.
* Improve compliance workflows (KYC, AML, concentration limits).

### **Key Milestones**

* First deposits routed into **fund-specific Blend pools**.
* Integration of **on-chain payments** and Blend yield tracking (APY, NAV, AUM).
* Enhanced manager/investor dashboards with performance charts and pool data.
* Global regulation scoping (GDPR, FATF, financial disclosures).


## **Q1 2026: Global Compliance and International Expansion**

### **Objectives**

* Strengthen global compliance (KYC/KYB, AML, data protection, reporting).
* Expand on-chain receivable payment functionality, enabling cross-border flows.
* Scale user base, with emphasis on international onboarding.

### **Key Milestones**

* Alignment with major regulatory standards (EU Crypto Directive, FATF).
* Full visibility of on-chain receivable flows for managers and auditors.
* Scaling to initial international pilots.
* Real-time on-chain audit trails for funds, receivables, and pools.


## **Q2 2026: Continuous Improvement and Global Adoption**

### **Objectives**

* Expand multi-currency support for receivable flows and investor deposits.
* Strengthen adaptation to high-regulation markets (US, EU, Asia).
* Optimize platform performance to support a growing number of funds and users.

### **Key Milestones**

* Multi-currency debtor payments and asset abstraction support.
* Fund pool tracking for yield, risk exposure, and concentration metrics.
* Growth in international investor and consultant networks.


## **Q3 2026: Globalization and Sustainable Growth**

### **Objectives**

* Consolidate platform usage across international fund managers.
* Integrate additional DeFi-based financial primitives for increased liquidity.
* Expand on-chain receivable payment functionality with instant cross-border flows.

### **Key Milestones**

* Integration with complementary DeFi protocols beyond Blend.
* Global real-time settlement experiences using XLM and tokenized assets.
* Scalable infrastructure capable of supporting billions in annual operations.

## **Operational Evidence Layer**

### **Objectives**

* End-to-end evidence for each agent/action (who did what, when), binding off-chain documents to on-chain commitments.
* Tamper-evident approvals and policy-driven document validation.
* Privacy-by-design architecture using encrypted off-chain storage + on-chain hashes.

### **Key Milestones**

* MVP: upload → encrypt & store → compute SHA-256 → emit doc_commit event on-chain.
* Policy engine for per-action document requirements and versioning.
* Evidence package export (documents + audit JSON log) with lifecycle and retention rules.

## **Conclusion**

This roadmap outlines the evolution of **The Simple Fund** from MVP to global adoption, leveraging blockchain tokenization, Blend yield pools, and non-custodial wallet infrastructure to transform receivables fund operations.  

Each phase enhances security, transparency, and liquidity, positioning the platform as a scalable and compliant solution capable of redefining how receivables funds operate worldwide.

Designed to go **beyond the Stellar hackathon**, the roadmap reflects the project’s long-term vision of global interoperability, regulatory alignment, and decentralized financial innovation.
