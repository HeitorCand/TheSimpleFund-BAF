## Customer Segments (Users)

Our solution targets three main personas:

- **Fund Managers (DTVMs)**: responsible for creating and managing funds but burdened with high operational costs, manual reconciliation, and low transparency.  
- **Consultants**: act as a bridge between originators and debtors but struggle to transmit credibility and use modern tools for origination.  
- **Investors**: seek transparent, liquid, and easy-to-track assets but face locked shares, limited reporting, and slow distribution cycles.  

## Customer Jobs (Tasks to Be Done)

Users need to:  
- **Manage and operate funds** efficiently.  
- **Register originators and debtors** in an auditable and reliable way.  
- **Invest, track, and exit operations** with liquidity, clarity, and user-controlled custody.  

## Customer Pains

- **Slow, manual processes**, which can take weeks to complete a single operation.  
- **High operational costs**, such as US$ 13 to process an invoice.  
- **Low transparency**, with fragmented information and occasional reports.  
- **Locked shares**, trapping investor capital until maturity.  
- **No real-time view of yield, risk, or NAV**, causing uncertainty for managers and investors.
