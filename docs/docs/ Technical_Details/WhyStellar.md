# Why Stellar?

## **Introduction**

The **Simple Fund** leverages the **Stellar blockchain** to transform the receivables fund market by providing transparency, speed, liquidity, and programmable yield. Stellar technologies are at the core of the solution, making the product scalable, cost-effective, and efficient. This section outlines why **Stellar** is essential for the project’s success, and how it enables **real-time, low-cost transactions and DeFi primitives** in a way that traditional systems cannot match.

With **Soroban smart contracts**, **non-custodial wallets** like **Freighter**, and DeFi protocols such as **Blend**, the Stellar ecosystem provides the ideal foundation for tokenized receivables funds with on-chain yield and global accessibility.

## **Practical Execution Plan**

The execution of **The Simple Fund** is built around the use of **Stellar’s blockchain and Soroban** to address core inefficiencies in the receivables fund market. Stellar’s capabilities enable **tokenization of fund shares**, **smart contracts for receivable flows and distributions**, **yield generation through Blend lending pools**, and **global liquidity** via the **Stellar DEX**.

1. **On-chain tokenization of fund shares and receivables**  
   We use Stellar and Soroban to **tokenize fund shares** as fungible assets and register **receivables** on-chain, representing real-world credit exposures. This makes receivables and fund interests more easily tradable, auditable, and composable with other DeFi building blocks.

2. **Real-time settlement**  
   With Stellar’s **low-cost infrastructure**, payments are processed in a few seconds with near-zero fees (approximately **$0.00001 per transaction**). This allows receivable flows, fund operations, and investor transactions to settle **in near real-time**, eliminating many delays that traditionally plague the industry.

3. **Automated distribution via Soroban smart contracts and Blend**  
   Smart contracts orchestrate the lifecycle of receivables and fund shares:  
   - capital allocation from the fund into **isolated Blend lending pools**,  
   - accrual of on-chain yield, and  
   - **automatic, pro-rata distribution** of returns to investors according to their share of the fund.  

   This removes manual interventions and enforces transparent, deterministic rules on-chain.

4. **Global liquidity through Stellar DEX and DeFi composability**  
   Tokenized fund shares can be listed and traded on the **Stellar DEX**, enabling **secondary market liquidity** for investors. In addition, by living on Stellar, these tokens can interact with other **DeFi protocols** and wallets in the ecosystem, increasing optionality and reach.

5. **Non-custodial access via Freighter**  
   Investors interact with the platform through **Freighter**, a non-custodial wallet, keeping full control over their assets while benefiting from the protocol’s automation and transparency.

## **Does the Product Work?**

Yes, the product works as intended at the proof-of-concept level. We have **deployed core functionalities on the Stellar testnet**, and tested:

* **Security**: Ensuring that funds and transactions are secure, signed by users via Freighter, and recorded immutably on-chain.
* **Scalability**: Stellar’s infrastructure can process thousands of transactions per second, allowing growth in the number of funds, receivables, and investors.
* **Usability**: The platform’s design focuses on simplicity for investors, consultants, and fund managers, wrapping blockchain complexity in clear, guided UX.

### **Proof of Concept**

The **MVP** has been tested in a **controlled environment**, simulating real-world receivable flows and investor operations. It demonstrated:

* successful tokenization of fund shares,  
* registration and handling of receivables,  
* interaction with Soroban smart contracts,  
* automated distributions, and  
* on-chain yield accounting via Blend pools.  

The **Stellar blockchain** and its tooling have proven capable of supporting these functions with minimal cost and high reliability.

## **Are Stellar Technologies Essential?**

Yes, Stellar technologies are **essential** for the success of **The Simple Fund**. Key reasons include:

1. **Low Cost**  
   Stellar’s transaction costs are **extremely low**, making micro-operations (small receivables, fractional fund shares, frequent distributions) economically viable. Traditional rails would make such granular operations prohibitively expensive.

2. **High Speed**  
   Stellar’s **transaction speed (around 3–5 seconds)** enables near real-time settlement of receivables and investor operations. This directly supports **liquidity**, frequent rebalancing, and efficient secondary trading on the **Stellar DEX**.

3. **Programmability with Soroban & DeFi Primitives**  
   Soroban provides a robust smart contract environment, and protocols like **Blend** add DeFi primitives such as **isolated lending pools** and backing modules. This combination allows The Simple Fund to:
   - allocate capital into on-chain yield strategies,  
   - manage risk per fund via isolated pools, and  
   - expose transparent APY and NAV directly from on-chain data.

4. **Compliance and Auditability**  
   Stellar was designed with **compliance use cases** in mind, supporting features important for **KYC/AML**, asset controls, and transaction auditing. Combined with our off-chain policies and database, it enables a traceable, auditable environment suitable for regulated financial products.

5. **Interoperability**  
   Stellar offers **interoperability with multiple assets and payment rails**, making it easier to support **multi-currency flows**, on/off-ramps, and integrations with other financial systems. This is crucial as The Simple Fund targets cross-border use cases and institutional adoption.

## **Is the Project Active on the Testnet?**

Yes, the project is actively running on the **Stellar testnet**. The testnet serves as an environment where all critical flows—from **fund share tokenization** to **receivable lifecycle management**, **Blend pool interactions**, and **automated distributions**—are tested before any move to mainnet.

### **Key Testnet Activities**

* **Tokenization testing**: Issuing and transferring tokenized fund shares to test wallets.  
* **Smart contract testing**: Deploying and invoking Soroban contracts for fund logic, receivables, and distribution rules.  
* **Blend integration testing**: Depositing into and withdrawing from Blend pools, validating yield accounting and risk isolation.  
* **Transaction performance testing**: Measuring speed and costs to validate scalability and user experience.

## **Conclusion**

Stellar’s **blockchain, Soroban smart contracts, and DeFi ecosystem** are foundational to **The Simple Fund**. They provide the **speed, low-cost transactions, programmability, and scalability** needed to transform the receivables fund industry into something **transparent, liquid, and globally accessible**.

By building on Stellar and integrating protocols like **Blend**, The Simple Fund can offer on-chain yield, non-custodial control, and institutional-grade auditability—bridging traditional receivables structures with modern, open financial infrastructure. With the project already active on the **Stellar testnet**, the path toward mainnet deployment and real-world adoption is clear and technically validated.
