# UX and UI 

## Introduction

**The Simple Fund** was designed to ensure an **accessible and enjoyable user experience**, with a **clean and intuitive interface** tailored to each user type: **Investor**, **Consultant**, and **Manager**. The platform combines a modern Web3 UX with non-custodial access through the **Freighter wallet**, ensuring that each user interacts directly with their assets. The interface prioritizes clarity, transparency, and ease of use, from onboarding to daily operations.

The use of **Stellar blockchain** and **smart contracts** ensures **security, transparency, and immutability**, while integrated analytics, real-time pricing, and DeFi yield data (via Blend pools) enhance decision-making and provide a richer experience.


## Investor Screen

### Accessibility and Usability

The **Investor** screen features a **clean, guided interface** that highlights:

- **Available funds** with tags (risk, sector, APY, duration)  
- **Current investments** and **portfolio performance**  
- **Share price (in XLM and USD)**  
- **NAV per share**, updated from on-chain pool balances  
- **Yield generated from Blend lending pools**

Charts and indicators provide visual insight into returns over time.  
A built-in **recommendation engine** suggests funds aligned with the investor’s risk profile and behavior.

### Non-Custodial Security

Investors connect through **Freighter**, enabling:

- direct token ownership,
- local signature of every transaction,
- transparent pricing,
- and immediate liquidity on the Stellar DEX.

All shares are tokenized and held **fully on-chain**, providing immutable proof of ownership and instant tradability.


## Consultant Screen

### Accessibility and Usability

The **Consultant** interface simplifies the onboarding and management of:

- **Assignors (cedentes)**  
- **Debtors (sacados)**  
- **Receivables** linked to specific funds  

Each action follows a guided workflow, with validation steps, visual status indicators, and intuitive forms. Consultants can also access fund concentration metrics (cedente, sacado, sector) and compliance-related information.

### Transparency and Security

All registrations are recorded **on-chain**, ensuring immutability and full auditability.  
Receivables linked to a fund update its risk and exposure parameters, providing transparency for managers and investors.


## Manager Screen

### Accessibility and Usability

The **Manager** dashboard provides a high-level overview of the entire fund operation, including:

- **Fund performance and historical returns**  
- **Blend pool status** (APY, total deposited, yield accrued)  
- **Cash flow insights from receivables**  
- **Investors, consultants, and order approvals**  
- **Share issuance, supply, and price controls**  

Managers can approve operations, monitor pool health, review exposures, and manage issuance directly through an intuitive control panel.

### Blockchain Reliability

On-chain data ensures real-time accuracy:

- **Smart contracts** automate share issuance, minting, and distributions  
- **Blend pools** provide isolated and secure yield generation  
- **Hard freeze** allows pausing fund operations when needed  
- **All activity is auditable** with transparent transaction hashes  


## Conclusion

The **UX** of **The Simple Fund** focuses on delivering a **simple, transparent, and highly secure** experience for all user types. Through a combination of **clean UI**, **non-custodial wallet integration**, **on-chain data**, and **DeFi yield mechanisms**, the platform provides users with full control over their assets while maintaining institutional-grade security and operational efficiency.

With this foundation, **The Simple Fund** redefines how receivables funds are managed, offering a modern, intuitive, and globally scalable Web3 experience.
