## Introduction

Every year, trillions in receivables get stuck in slow, opaque processes—capital that could fuel growth but instead disappears into back-office inefficiencies. The receivables fund industry suffers from high operational costs, manual reconciliation, and chronic illiquidity for investors.

Take agribusiness as an example: a farming company sells goods on credit to a trading firm. In need of immediate capital, it sells the receivable to a fund at a discount. On paper, the flow is simple: assignor → fund → debtor → investors. In practice, however, this process gets bogged down by manual KYC, fragmented data, reconciliation delays, and a lack of transparency.

**The Simple Fund** emerges as a blockchain-native infrastructure for receivables funds on Stellar—turning fund shares into digital tokens, registering assignors and debtors on-chain, deploying capital into isolated Blend lending pools to earn yield, and giving investors non-custodial access via wallets such as Freighter. The platform includes intelligent **AI-powered fund recommendations** based on investor behavior, **privacy-preserving ZK investor badges** (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond tiers), and **real-time pricing** through CoinGecko integration.

## The Problem

* **$0.32 lost per $1,000** of revenue due to outdated data and manual errors.
* **$13** to process a single invoice.
* **3 weeks** average settlement time per operation.
* **$7.2 million/year** in costs for large funds.
* **Minimal liquidity** for investors, with long lock-ups.

These bottlenecks make the traditional system expensive, slow, and unattractive in a world that demands speed and transparency.

## The Solution

**The Simple Fund** addresses these structural inefficiencies with blockchain infrastructure:

1. **Tokenization** — Managers convert fund shares into fungible Stellar tokens governed by smart contracts.
2. **On-Chain Registry** — Consultants register assignors (cedentes) and debtors (sacados) with full transparency.
3. **Automated Distribution** — Smart contracts coordinate receivable cash flows and yield from Blend lending pools, distributing returns proportionally and on-chain.
4. **Global Liquidity** — Shares become tradable instantly on the Stellar DEX and can be integrated into other DeFi primitives.
5. **On-Chain Yield & Pricing** — Fund capital is allocated into isolated Blend lending pools, with APY, NAV, and share price updated from protocol data and XLM–USD quotes via CoinGecko.

An embedded **AI recommendation engine** leverages fund metadata (risk level, sector, duration, minimum ticket), performance, and user interactions to suggest funds that better match each investor's profile and objectives. Additionally, investors earn **privacy-preserving ZK badges** as they increase their total investment volume, unlocking future benefits while keeping actual amounts private.

The result: fast, auditable, and scalable operations delivered through a **B2B SaaS model** for fund managers, enhanced by **real-time XLM/USD pricing via CoinGecko** for transparent portfolio valuation.

## Global Impact

* **For Managers**: Real-time dashboards replace manual reconciliation; “hard freeze” provides one-click control over issuance and transfers, while on-chain data from Blend pools, prices, and receivables flows supports compliance, risk monitoring, and reporting.
* **For Investors**: Shares are stored in their own non-custodial wallet (e.g., Freighter), with public issuance history, transparent APY and NAV, risk and sector tags, and immediate secondary liquidity—plus personalized fund recommendations.
* **For Consultants**: 100% digital onboarding with auditable on-chain approval trails, linking each assignor and debtor to specific funds and concentration limits.

With Stellar’s capacity to process transactions in **~5 seconds at a cost of $0.00001**, micro-sized allocations, periodic distributions, and dynamic fund rebalancing become globally viable—positioning The Simple Fund for rapid international scale.

## Conclusion

**The Simple Fund** is not just a platform—it is a new standard for receivables funds. By combining **tokenization, DeFi yield via Blend, smart contracts, non-custodial wallets, recommendation intelligence, and global liquidity**, it transforms a traditionally expensive and inefficient process into one that is **transparent, liquid, and global**.

Backed by Stellar’s proven infrastructure, the solution aligns with the trillion-dollar growth of receivables financing and the rapid expansion of tokenized assets worldwide.
